# Siamese Method
It's a simple method to construct magic squares of odd order that I have implemented in code. \
Magic Square: In mathematics, a square array of numbers, is called a magic square if the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same. The order of a magic square is the number of rows or columns in that 2D array. \

This method is more descriptive than mathematical. So, for writing the code, I needed to make slight generalization. The math part will be added later.
