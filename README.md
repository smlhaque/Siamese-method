# Magic Square
In mathematics, a square array of numbers, is called a magic square if the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same. The order($n$) of a magic square is the number of rows or columns in that 2D array. \

There are different methods for building magic squares of different orders. Most generally, there are 3 methods. <br/> <br/>
**<ins>1) Siamese Method:</ins>**
A method for constructing magic squares of order $n=2k+1$ (odd ordered). For more info, visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_method .\
<br/>
**<ins>2) Strachey Method:</ins>**
A method for constructing magic squares of order $n=4k+2$ (singly even ordered). For more info, visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strachey_method_for_magic_squares .\
<br/>
**<ins>3) Modified Crossed-diagonal Method:</ins>**
A method for constructing magic squares of order $n=4k$ (doubly even ordered). For more info, visit: https://www.1728.org/magicsq2.htm . <br/><br/>
(Note: The code is not fully optimized as it focuses more on implementing the process than getting to the final result.)
